# TokenSpeed-MLA

Speed-of-light TokenSpeed MLA kernels for `SM100/SM103/SM107` with:

- `MLA prefill`:
  - CuTe DSL JIT backend for ragged varlen FMHA (no padding)
  - BF16 output, optional LSE output, causal/non-causal modes, PDL support
- `MLA decode`:
  - CuTe DSL decode kernels for FP16/BF16/FP8 input paths
  - FP8 decode writes BF16 output for better downstream stability
  - Split-KV + workspace path with runtime auto-sizing and compile caching
- `MLA K/V pack + FP8 quantize`:
  - Fused Triton kernel replacing `cat + cast + cast` in chunked prefill
  - Supports strided views and optional pre-allocated output buffers

This package includes performance-oriented optimizations for latency-sensitive
serving workloads, especially coding agent style use cases with high request
concurrency, short decode steps, and strict time-to-first-token/next-token
requirements. For MLA decode kernel, small `q_len * num_heads`
configurations can fold a query-token group (`fold_sq_factor`) into heads for
better tile utilization; remaining query groups are scheduled across the query
sequence dimension.

SM107 support requires CuTe DSL 4.8.0 or newer and a compatible CUDA toolkit.

## Performance Numbers

### Prefill Performance

Where:
```
use case 1: batch_size = 1, seqlen_qo = 8 * 1024, seqlen_kv = 8 * 1024
use case 2: batch_size = 1, seqlen_qo = 8 * 1024, seqlen_kv = 32 * 1024
use case 3: batch_size = 1, seqlen_qo = 8 * 1024, seqlen_kv = 64 * 1024
use case 4: batch_size = 4, seqlen_qo = 512,      seqlen_kv = 80 * 1024
use case 5: batch_size = 4, seqlen_qo = 1024,     seqlen_kv = 80 * 1024
```

The prefill comparison above includes historical results from an AOT
implementation. Current releases ship the public CuTe DSL JIT implementation;
the historical AOT backend is not included in the package.

### Decode Performance

![Decode Latency Comparison for num_heads=16](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lightseekorg/tokenspeed/main/tokenspeed-mla/assets/latency_comparison_numHead16.png)
![Decode Latency Comparison for num_heads=32](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lightseekorg/tokenspeed/main/tokenspeed-mla/assets/latency_comparison_numHead32.png)

In the above test cases, `q_seqlen = 4` and `kv_seqlen = 80K`.

TensorRT-LLM uses a single kernel for MLA decode, which appears to adopt a swap-AB strategy in the tested cases. In contrast, TokenSpeed’s MLA decode kernel uses a two-kernel implementation: one kernel computes the MLA decode with split-KV, and a second kernel performs the reduction of the split-KV partial results.

Key Optimization of TokenSpeed MLA decode kernel: Group `q_seqlen` and `num_heads` into BMM1 `M`

In `mla_decode.py`, `mla_decode_fp16.py`, and `mla_decode_fp8.py`, decode uses
`fold_sq_factor` to partially fold query tokens into the head axis when
`num_heads < 128`. `q_seqlen` can be any positive length; the runtime chooses
the largest factor `F` such that: `q_seqlen % F == 0` and
`num_heads * F <= 128`. If no factor greater than one divides `q_seqlen`, the
kernel does not fold and schedules the full query sequence dimension directly.

The folded execution shape becomes:
- `H_eff = num_heads * F`
- `q_seqlen_eff = q_seqlen / F`

This improves BMM1 `M`-dimension utilization and reduces tile waste in small-head
decode scenarios, especially token-by-token agent traffic. Example:
`num_heads=64, q_seqlen=4` chooses `F=2`, so two query tokens are folded into
`M` (`H_eff=128`) and the remaining two query groups are scheduled on the
scheduler second dimension (`q_seqlen_eff=2`).

The public `tokenspeed_mla_decode` also accepts `enable_packed_q=True` to
opt into continuous query/head packing on the FP8 and FP16/BF16 M128 paths, adapted from
FlashInfer PR #4178. The default is **False**, preserving the folded-query
implementation. M64 and token-gapped Q/output views continue to
use that implementation even when the option is enabled.

Packed rows are ordered as `query_token * num_heads + head`. Each 2-CTA
group owns 128 consecutive rows, including across query boundaries. Thus
H96/Sq4 uses three query tiles instead of four, and H96/Sq8 uses six
instead of eight. Only the final tile may contain padding. This is a tensor
view transformation, with no additional packing kernel. The kernel uses
per-row causal positions and predicates partial output/LSE rows.

For packed queries, auto split-KV uses `ceil(H * q_len / 128)` query tiles,
and workspace needs `B * 128 * ceil(H * q_len / 128) * split_kv * 513 * 4`
bytes for D512/FP32 partials, or zero when split-KV is one. Callers enabling
this option must provide sufficient workspace. Output shape, output dtype
(BF16 for FP8; input dtype for FP16/BF16), and base-2 LSE semantics are unchanged.
The FP16/BF16 implementation retains its existing split-KV heuristic, reducer
capacity and PDL waits. The option is part of the
compile cache key. Existing direct kernel callers retain the old layout;
opting in through the public wrapper keeps tiling and workspace consistent.

Sliding-window and DCP masking remain supported; window boundaries use the
packed row's original query-token position.

Regression coverage is in [tests/test_mla_decode.py](tests/test_mla_decode.py).
It checks packed-query geometry, split-KV workspace sizing, FP8/FP16/BF16
outputs and LSE, reducer variants, CUDA-graph replay, sliding windows and DCP.

```bash
PYTHONPATH=tokenspeed-mla/python python -m pytest -q tokenspeed-mla/tests/test_mla_decode.py
```

GPU cases require SM100, SM103 or SM107 and are skipped on other devices.
Add `-k 'not TestGPU and not TestCompile'` for CPU checks, `-k TestCompile`
for compilation checks across all three architectures, or `-k TestGPU` for
GPU checks. Compilation checks require a CuTe DSL and CUDA toolchain that
support the target architecture, even when no GPU is visible.

### SM107 decode

FP8 and FP16/BF16 decode share the existing kernel classes, scheduler,
split-KV reducer and masking logic across SM100, SM103 and SM107. The public
wrapper selects the architecture from `query.device` and includes it in the
compile cache key and compiler target. Direct kernel construction requires
an explicit `compute_capability=(10, 0)`, `(10, 3)` or `(10, 7)`.

Other optimizations include:

- FP8 split-KV candidates are normalized to nonempty K partitions before
  workspace allocation and kernel launch. The reducer uses a 32/64-split
  capacity for the M128/M64 paths and selects 1/2/4 disjoint D512 output bands
  when the real output rows do not fill the GPU. These changes adapt the
  split-KV and reducer optimizations from FlashInfer PR #4178 to TokenSpeed's
  folded-query layout; both reducer settings are included in the compile cache.
- Using 2CTA UTCMMA instruction to reduce shared memory usage.
- Try to use as less mbarrier as possible.
- Split kv loading warp to get more latency hiding ability. After loading K, V is already in the L2 cache. Loading K of next tile will not have to wait for the completion of V loading.
- Using multiple stage (sub-tiling) for STG in epilogue.

## Kernel Capability Summary

### MLA Prefill (`tokenspeed_mla_prefill`)

What it supports:

- Ragged varlen prefill without padding:
  - `Q: [sum(q_lens), h_q, d_qk]`
  - `K: [sum(kv_lens), h_k, d_qk]`
  - `V: [sum(kv_lens), h_k, d_v]`
- Different Q/KV sequence packs (`cum_seq_lens_q` and `cum_seq_lens_kv` can differ)
- Causal and non-causal execution
- Optional LSE return (`return_lse=True`)
- PDL enable/disable (`enable_pdl`)
- Kernel compile cache keyed by static config (`dtype`, `d_qk`, `d_v`, causal, LSE, PDL, etc.)
- Skip-correction is enabled in the wrapped FMHA path.
- ex2-emulation (disabled by default on B200, and not supported on B300)
- CuTe DSL JIT backend

Input/output dtype behavior:

- CuTe DSL backend accepts input dtypes supported :
  - `torch.float16`, `torch.bfloat16`, `torch.float8_e4m3fn`, `torch.float8_e5m2`
  - MLA Prefill only support `torch.float8_e4m3fn`
- Prefill output tensor is BF16 (`torch.bfloat16`)
- Optional LSE output is FP32

### MLA Decode (`tokenspeed_mla_decode`)

What it supports:

- Query shape: `[B, q_len, H, kv_lora_rank + qk_rope_head_dim]`
- KV cache shape:
  - 3D: `[num_pages, page_size, D_total]`
  - 4D accepted and normalized internally
- Auto `split_kv` + workspace sizing and caching
- Supports FP16/BF16/FP8; FP8 path writes BF16 output.
- Supports `H <= 128` and `1 <= q_len <= 4`; for example,
  `H=64, q_len=4` is supported.
- `split_kv` and `workspace_size` are computed and cached from runtime shape/device info.
- `is_var_seq`, `is_persistent`, and `enable_pdl` affect scheduling/compile variants.
- `causal_mask` supports causal and non-causal execution on FP16/BF16/FP8 paths.
- `window_left` bounds each block row's history: row `i` sees keys
  `[max(0, K - q_len - window_left + i), k_bound)`, the whole `q_len` block plus
  `window_left` tokens of context. The kernel starts its KV walk at the window
  rather than at key 0, so cost tracks the window, not the cache. `-1` (the
  default) is full history and compiles the same kernel it always did.
- Optional `out` tensor reuse
- `is_var_seq` and `enable_pdl` controls

```python
import torch
from tokenspeed_mla import tokenspeed_mla_decode

# query: [B, q_len, H, D_qk]

```

## Releases

The [release-tokenspeed-mla workflow](https://github.com/lightseekorg/tokenspeed/actions/workflows/release-tokenspeed-mla.yml)
builds a source-only `py3-none-any` wheel from this repository and publishes it to
PyPI. Packaging does not require a GPU or CUDA compiler; the kernels compile with
CuTe DSL and Triton at runtime.

Before the first release through this workflow, configure a
[PyPI Trusted Publisher](https://docs.pypi.org/trusted-publishers/adding-a-publisher/)
for the existing `tokenspeed-mla` project:

- Owner: `lightseekorg`
- Repository: `tokenspeed`
- Workflow filename: `release-tokenspeed-mla.yml`
- Environment: `pypi`

Release steps:

1. Merge kernel changes, then update `[project].version` in
   `tokenspeed-mla/pyproject.toml` when a release is needed. Prefer a separate
   version-bump PR; multiple code changes can share one release.
2. After merging the version bump, dispatch from `main`:
   `gh workflow run release-tokenspeed-mla.yml -R lightseekorg/tokenspeed --ref main`.
   The workflow refuses versions already present on PyPI and checks the wheel's
   metadata, JIT sources, and license notices before publishing.
3. Wait for PyPI publication, then use `update-tokenspeed-kernel-mla.yml` with
   `mla_version=<version>` to open the dependency-update PR.

For local packaging checks, use Python 3.12 and install `build`, `packaging`,
`pytest`, and `twine` in a virtual environment. From the repository root:

```bash
(cd tokenspeed-mla && python -m pytest tests/test_release.py -q)
python -m build tokenspeed-mla --wheel --outdir dist
python -m twine check --strict dist/*
python tokenspeed-mla/scripts/check_release.py --package-dir tokenspeed-mla --dist-dir dist
```

### FP8 split-KV partial storage

FP8 decode keeps split-KV partial outputs in FP32 by default. Set
`TOKENSPEED_MLA_FP16_PARTIALS=1` before importing the package to opt into FP16
partial storage. Accumulation and log-sum-exp remain FP32; the reducer applies
`output_scale` after combining normalized partials. Direct FP8 kernel callers
must explicitly specify `partial_fp16` and a `reducer_max_splits` capacity that
covers every split in their launches.
