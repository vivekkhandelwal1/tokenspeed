# Event Loop: Design Principles

This document records the design principles of the scheduler event loop
(`python/tokenspeed/runtime/engine/event_loop.py`). It is the reference for
where new logic belongs, how components feed results back into the scheduler,
and what the loop body itself is allowed to contain. The rules below were
established deliberately; treat deviations as bugs in review.

## Principle 1: the loop runs no GPU work, and cannot reach any

The event loop is the **control plane**: ZMQ input, gloo collectives, the C++
scheduler, commit post-processing. `ForwardThread`
(`execution/forward_thread.py`) is the **data plane**: one thread per rank,
FIFO, everything that touches CUDA. A control-plane round is microseconds, so
the cross-rank collectives that keep the redundant schedulers aligned always
find every rank promptly, however deep the GPUs are in queued work — a stage's
launch-queue backpressure stalls only its own forward thread, never the round.

FIFO describes submission ownership, not a promise that every model kernel
uses one CUDA stream. Main-stream scratch and persistent kernel protocol state
may be shared across calls only while those calls are ordered on that stream.
Work deliberately forked to a side stream must use private storage or establish
an ordering edge before touching a shared layout; joining the side stream later
does not make concurrent reuse safe.

This is enforced by **visibility**, not by discipline. `build_device_side`
(`execution/device.py`) constructs the model runners, attention backends, KV
pools and executor as its own locals, and returns one `DeviceBuild`, split by
how long the caller may hold each piece:

| | what it is | lifetime |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DeviceSpecs` | plain values the loop plans with: cache geometry, cache groups, speculation widths, capability flags | keep forever |
| `DeviceHandle` | the running handle: the complete list of what the loop may ask of the device side | the only one stored (`self._device`) |
| `transfer` | the PD peer's CONTROL face — bootstrap register/abort, event polling — or None outside PD | held by the PD hooks |
| `encoder_model_facts` | a callable resolving the encoder facts EPD admission needs (raises on text-only) | consumed at startup, past the EPD gate |

The device side is built **complete**, not built-then-wired: the transfer peer
is constructed inside the builder from its prepared components and startup
arguments, and the engine's role is read off it once, at construction. An
earlier shape had the loop assemble the peer and hand it back through a setter,
which left the role mutable after startup for no reason.

Persistent DeepEP communication storage is reserved during common MoE weight
processing, before attention/cache construction profiles available memory.
The kernel package owns allocation and compatible reuse; this rule is shared
by every DeepEP backend. Runtime orchestration supplies configuration but does
not infer token layouts or capacities from model names. Backend dispatchers
reuse that storage when model execution begins.

Attention construction returns a frozen, named `AttentionBuild` containing its
backends, pools, cache storage, field placement/readiness and optional logical plan.
`build_device_side` consumes this result locally and passes stage field
placement, producer readiness and `logical_plan` explicitly through PD
construction to `get_kv_args`.
These startup dependencies stay within device construction; neither the build
result nor its ownership/layout fields are exposed to the event loop.

The handle owns BOTH executors of a scheduler plan, and treats their work
identically: a model forward runs asynchronously on the GPU, and handing a
prefill or decode to the peer node is asynchronous work of exactly the same
standing. The plan separates its streams by executor — the `ForwardBatch`
is the model's work, `plan.remote_prefill` is the peer's on a D node (pull
the admitted prompt's KV in), `plan.remote_decode` the peer's on a P node
(the completed prompt decodes over there, so its KV goes out). The remote
streams ride beside whatever forward work the round schedules, occupy no
batch slot, and go out even on rounds with no batch at all — everything
dispatchable dispatches in one round. Vanished-L3 recovery is the one
withhold: it retracts `plan.remote_prefill` request ids with the local
forward and does not submit that stream, so the peer cannot land
suffix-only KV on empty prefix pages. The transfer moves
KV-pool device memory over RDMA rather than through a CUDA kernel, but it
needs the same ordering against forwards and page zeroing — so its execution
face lives behind the handle too, attached once at startup. Its control face
(bootstrap register/abort, event polling, `pop_*`) stays on the control
plane, where it feeds Principle 3's tail advance.

Consequences:

* The loop cannot **name** a model runner, backend or KV pool, so it cannot
  pass one implicitly or mutate one a forward is still using. A test asserts
  this over the AST of `EventLoop.__init__` — locals included, because a name
  it can write is a name a later change can keep.
* A new device interaction belongs **inside the builder** if it runs once at
  startup, and on `DeviceHandle` only if the running loop genuinely needs it —
  the second widens what the loop can do to the GPU mid-flight. Hand over the
  capability, never the object.
* Every method on the handle is a **named operation**, with one registered
  exception: `run_multimodal_work`, because multimodal feature lifecycle is a
  state machine reached from several control-plane points (EPD admission's
  stage/drain device half; the commit-side SHM release). A generic "run this
  closure" slot is the hole this whole design closes, so a second KIND of
  user does not join it — it gets its own name.
  The architecture test pins the exact public operation names, not a numeric
  size limit. L3 adds named Host-tier operations for existence/readability
  probes, prefetch planning/results, failed-read invalidation, namespace and
  weight-version changes, and cache shutdown. These keep the executor and
  Host buffer hidden; they do not introduce another generic work slot.
  Changing this surface requires updating both this contract and the explicit
  operation allowlist in `test/runtime/test_device_handle.py`.
* The role is a **value** (`DeviceRole`), not a class hierarchy. Subclassing
  per role forced the handle to publish its own internals so the subclasses
  could call back into it — a reference cycle for about a dozen lines of
  difference. With every remote op on its own plan stream, the batch needs
  no per-role reading at all: a `ForwardBatch` is model work, full stop, and
  a DP rank counts work by simply asking whether the batch has tokens.
* Collaborators are **given** the handle in their constructor. Do not reach it
  through another object (`loop._device...`): a traversal is the seam the next
  change widens, first to the handle and then to whatever it exposes.
* On the per-round path only commit waits, through `PendingExecution.result()`:
  join the forward thread's future (launches issued), then its copy event (D2H
  landed). Dispatch never waits — model forwards and the peer's remote
  prefills/decodes alike are submitted fire-and-forget, which is what keeps a
  backpressured stage off the control plane. The remote submissions' only
  failure surface is a settle at the next round's `execute` (their semantic
  completion arrives through the transfer events; a submission that RAISED
  produces none, so it must not be swallowed). The handle's remaining `run_*`
  methods do block, deliberately — the DP idle forward, the landing of a
  completed remote prefill, the KV repair after a wake, the RL weight sync —
  but each is a low-rate path whose caller cannot proceed without the result
  (the landing's failure must surface BEFORE the scheduler advances the
  request into decode). A new blocking method on the per-round path is a bug.
* Keep per-forward state resets asynchronous on the execution stream too.
  Use device-side scalar fills for indexed flags: assigning a Python scalar
  through tensor indexing can stage a CPU tensor and introduce a hidden
  synchronous H2D copy, blocking further forward launches.

The rule is also mechanically enforced, on by default: a thread-local
dispatch mode over the loop raises on any CUDA tensor op run from the
control thread. Event waits — the inbound channel — and metadata-only view
ops pass untouched; neither submits device work.
``TOKENSPEED_GUARD_CONTROL_PLANE=0`` is the escape hatch for a deployment
that trips on an unrouted op (report it). EPD prefill admission, the one
known violator, now crosses through ``DeviceHandle.run_multimodal_work``:
receive-buffer allocation, the publish clone/scatter, and the NCCL shard
reassembly all run on the forward thread — which also puts the reassembly
broadcasts on the same issuing thread as the model's collectives, restoring
the cross-rank launch-order guarantee the old non-overlap-loop assumption
provided.

The symmetric rule holds on the data plane: **the forward thread never
synchronizes with the device on the per-round path.** Every host
synchronization it performs — `.cpu()`, `.item()`, `.tolist()`,
`bool(tensor)`, `nonzero`, a copy from or to pageable host memory,
`stream.synchronize()` — waits for the whole stream, and the stream holds
the step in flight, so the next step's prologue and graph launch slip
behind the current step's completion and `in_flight_depth` degrades to 0
however it is configured. Results cross back through pinned non-blocking
copies and an event the control plane waits on. This rule is enforced by
torch's sync-debug mode, armed by `run_event_loop` as its last step before
entering the round loop (weight loading, tuning, capture, the transfer and
L2 builders and `EventLoop.__init__` all synchronize on purpose):
`TOKENSPEED_DATA_PLANE_SYNC_DEBUG=warn` reports each offending site with its
Python location, `error` raises there. CI runs the serving paths with
`error`; the control plane's event wait and non-blocking copies are not
flagged, so a report is always a real stall.

### The capture contract

Information crosses to the data plane **only** inside the submitted closure,
and is frozen once submitted: no attribute rebinding, no in-place edit, no
releasing a resource the closure captured. Capture plain values or a snapshot,
and bind at capture time rather than closing over a variable the caller will
rebind. Results cross back **only** through `PendingExecution.result()`.

L3 Host prefetch results follow the same capture rule. The control plane
prefetches and converges each plan's outcome, then `DeviceHandle.execute`
detaches that result into the queued load-back submission. The forward thread
never reads the executor's current-round prefetch dictionary: another round
may already have replaced or invalidated it while the submission was queued.

`execution/forward_thread.py` states this in full, including the single
registered exception — grammar matchers, whose ownership is split by path and
whose overlap is instead broken by the drain registry in Principle 4.

## Principle 2: the event loop is a coordinator, nothing more

`EventLoop.event_loop` sequences components; it does not implement them.
Domain logic — pause/resume semantics, EPD admission, PD transfer handling,
L2 cache-op tracking, L3 admission/recovery, wire handshakes, multimodal batch
assembly — lives in its own module and enters the loop as a **single-line hook**.
The loop body
should read, top to bottom, as the schedule of one scheduling round, with no
feature's internals inlined into it.

Consequences:

* Low-frequency or optional features (pause/resume control, EPD, SMG
  transport, kvstore) must never make the *normal* scheduling path harder to
  read. If understanding decode throughput requires skipping over your
  feature's code, the feature is in the wrong place.
* When a feature needs several collaborators of the loop, give it a hooks
  class (see below) instead of weaving branches through the loop and its
  helpers.

## Principle 3: scheduler feedback is explicit and centralized

`advance_scheduler` (`scheduler_utils.py`) is the **only** caller of
`scheduler.advance`, and it is invoked **only explicitly and directly in the
`event_loop` body — never from helpers**. Helpers RETURN their events; the
loop applies them. Reading the loop body alone must reveal every point where
the scheduler's state advances, and why.

There are exactly two call sites, each with a documented reason:

* **Head of the round** — completed L2 cache-op events
  (`_cache_hooks.poll_ready_events()`). These must advance *before*
  `next_execution_plan`, otherwise cache-gated admissions are delayed by a
  full round.
* **Tail of the round** — forward results, PD transfer events and L3 prefetch
  recovery retracts, funneled through the single `request_changes` list.
  Recovery retracts follow commits of older in-flight forwards; all events
  must advance before the *next* round plans.

Anything that produces scheduler events (a new transfer backend, a new async
op kind) either returns events into one of these two points or adds a new
explicit call site in the loop body with a comment stating why the existing
points don't fit. It must not call `advance_scheduler` itself.

## Principle 4: correctness never depends on the in-flight depth

The loop is parameterized by `in_flight_depth`: 0 (classic synchronous
commit), 1 (the overlap schedule), or `pp_size` (the prefill chunk pipeline).
Dispatched forwards await commit in the `in_flight` queue; the tail commits
once the queue exceeds the effective depth (0 when the round dispatched no
new work, so results never wait on future traffic).

The depth is a performance knob only. Any dispatch whose inputs depend on a
pending commit's side effects must drain the queue first, and
`_dispatch_depends_on_pending_commit` is the **single registry** of those
overlap-breaking dependencies (currently: eager-grammar batches). New rules go
there, not into `event_loop`. Rounds that run no real forward (pause/freeze,
DP idle) drain the queue fully.

Prefer removing a dependency over registering one. The P-side remote decode
was registered here until the C++ scheduler learned to hold it until its
final chunk's forward result lands (it now rides `plan.remote_decode`,
beside the batch): a request turns `PrefillDone` when its last chunk is
*scheduled*, so the transfer was being planned while that chunk was still in
flight, and satisfying it meant draining the whole queue — under PP,
emptying the chunk pipeline every time a prompt finished prefill. The
dependency was real; the right fix was upstream, not a drain.

Depth ≥ 1 also means a round is planned *before* the previous round's commit,
so a batch can contain a request that commit is about to finish. Anything the
control plane frees on that commit — a request's shared multimodal features,
for instance — must be released through the handle so the FIFO orders it
behind the forward that captured it, not inline.

## Principle 5: publishing drains, once per round

`_publish_scheduler_kv_events` has drain semantics: cache mutations
accumulate inside the C++ scheduler across any number of calls (advance,
`next_execution_plan`), so a single unconditional call at the loop tail
publishes everything the round produced, in order, as one batch. The batch
is the round's net change: a block evicted and cached again within the round
produces no event. Do not add per-mutation publish calls; they only fragment
batches.

The same reasoning fixes the metrics call: scheduler iteration metrics are
recorded once per round, from the same pre-dispatch snapshot as the
scheduler stats.

Page gauges count LCM parents, excluding the reserved null parent. The
per-round sampler reads `empty_lcm_blocks()` and `active_lcm_blocks()`;
cached-only parents are `num_usable_pages - empty - active`. Active and cached
counts are disjoint, even when cache groups pack multiple blocks into a parent.
`LoadSnapshot.num_used_pages` sums active and cached parents to report all
resident occupancy, including evictable cache, rather than cache alone.
`available_lcm_blocks()` scans the pool and prefix indexes for reclaimability
and belongs in diagnostics and leak checks, never in the per-round sampler.

## The hooks pattern

Loop-side integration of a subsystem is a small class whose methods are the
subsystem's only entry points from the loop. Two shapes exist:

* **Glue hooks** hold a loop back-reference and act on its collaborators;
  they are stateless (or nearly so) because the real state machine lives in a
  controller the request handler or device drives. The controller DECIDES;
  the hooks ACT with the loop's collaborators. Any capability they need — the
  `DeviceHandle` above all — is injected in their constructor, per Principle 1.
* **Self-contained components** own their state outright and depend only on
  static configuration — they need no loop reference at all. Prefer this
  shape whenever the subsystem doesn't genuinely need the loop's live state.

Current inventory:

| Attribute      | Class / home                                  | Shape          | Loop entry points |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------- | -------------- | ----------------- |
| `_pause_hooks` | `PauseHooks` — `engine/pause.py`              | glue (PauseController is the state machine) | `apply_transitions`, `withhold_admissions`, `paused_idle_step` |
| `_epd_hooks`   | `EpdPrefillHooks` — `epd/prefill_hooks.py`    | glue (EpdPrefillAdmission decides)          | `try_stage`, `drain_ready_embeddings`, `assert_embeddings_received` |
| `_pd_hooks`    | `PdTransferHooks` — `pd/transfer_hooks.py`    | glue (transfer executors decide)            | `poll_transfer_events` |
| `_cache_hooks` | `L2CacheHooks` — `engine/cache_hooks.py`      | glue-ish (handed the `DeviceHandle`: submission rides `execute`; polling stays control-side event queries) | `count_plan_ops`, `poll_ready_events` |
| `_l3_hooks` | `L3CacheHooks` — `engine/l3_cache_hooks.py` | self-contained (injected scheduler, `DeviceHandle`, static replica groups; no loop reference) | `submit_requests`, `revalidate_queued_hits`, `prepare_forward` |

`_pause_hooks` and `_pd_hooks` are also handed the `DeviceHandle`: both have
work that must land on the data plane — the DP idle forward and the KV repair
after a memory-saver wake, and the device writes a completed remote prefill
lands. `PauseHooks` additionally supplies `reset_caches_for_release` and
`kv_repair_after_wake` to the memory-occupation controller as callbacks; those
are not loop entry points, they fire on release/wake.

`L3CacheHooks` owns prefix registration at submission, candidate revalidation
before planning, and replica-wide prefetch recovery. It returns the safe forward
and recovery events, never advancing the scheduler. A miss suppresses the
model batch and remote-prefill submission while the plan's cache ops still
execute. The loop drains older forwards before applying recovery at its tail.
With L3 disabled, the same hooks submit requests without token hashing, storage
probes or replica collectives. Storage state and per-plan prefetch snapshots
remain behind `DeviceHandle`; namespace deletion and flush coordination stay
in `RequestHandler`.

Per-round dispatch needs no hooks class at all: the loop hands
`DeviceHandle.execute` the plan and the round's `PlannedForward`, and the
plan's streams already say who runs what — the batch is the model's, the
remote streams are the transfer peer's.

Related placements that follow the same principle without a hooks class: the
SMG startup handshake lives in `zmq_msgpack.connect_msgpack_engine_for_loop`
(wire-schema helpers in `zmq_wire`), multimodal batch-context assembly in
`multimodal/inputs.py::multimodal_context_for_forward` (which also snapshots
each request's multimodal inputs, per Principle 1's capture contract), and
P-side layerwise KV streaming setup, which happens inside the device builder
(the step counter is backend surgery; the sender just receives it). Dest-
contiguous CachePD fragments are 2D-packed in the Prefill transfer path
before Mooncake WRITE — that CUDA copy is data-plane work, not loop work.

All hooks obey Principle 3: they return events or decisions; they never call
`advance_scheduler`.

An empty memory-resume request is a successful no-op while a drain is
pending. It must preserve that drain's admission hold until the owning
pause or memory-release operation finishes.

## Anatomy of a round

For orientation, one iteration of `event_loop`:

1. Receive and admit new requests (`_process_new_requests`), with the pause
   and EPD admission hooks inline as single lines.
2. Poll completed L2 cache ops; **advance the scheduler (head call site)** so
   this round's plan sees them.
3. Frozen (`PAUSED_ALL`)? Drain the in-flight queue and run the paused idle
   step. Otherwise: revalidate queued L3 hits, plan (`next_execution_plan`),
   derive the forward op, record metrics, DP-sync, and gather per-batch state
   (draining the in-flight queue first if the dispatch depends on a pending
   commit, Principle 4).
4. **One `DeviceHandle.execute(plan, planned)` call per round**, in an order
   that is itself a correctness contract for same-round page reuse:
   host-cache write-backs first (a retraction's snapshot copy must read the
   reused pages' old bytes, so its op is stream-ordered and fences the
   forward thread's stream on its completion here; an ordinary store's
   sources are pinned by the scheduler until the ACK, so its copy rides the
   write stream and fences nothing), then page zeroing (the new owner's
   sanitization), then load-backs (they target zeroed pages), then the
   plan's remote streams to the transfer peer (a D-node remote prefill
   waits on the zeroing fence inside its submission, which the FIFO orders
   after the write-back fence), then the plan's batch to the model. `planned` is
   None on idle and empty rounds; the plan's own work (hygiene, the remote
   streams) still runs. Then commit from the queue head down to the
   effective depth and poll PD transfer events.
5. **Advance the scheduler (tail call site)** with the round's
   `request_changes`, publish KV events (once), and resolve any pending
   pause/release drain.

## Checklist for extending the loop

* New logic that reacts to scheduler/transfer/cache progress: put it in the
  matching hooks class (or add one), return events, and apply them at an
  existing advance point.
* New device interaction: inside `build_device_side` if it is startup-only,
  `DeviceHandle` if the running loop needs it — and inject the handle into
  whoever needs it rather than traversing to it.
* New reason a dispatch cannot overlap a pending commit: add it to
  `_dispatch_depends_on_pending_commit`.
* New per-round work: add a single-line hook call at a fixed position in the
  loop (rank-identical across ranks if it contains collectives), not a
  branch of feature code.
* Never call `scheduler.advance`, `advance_scheduler`, or the KV event
  publisher from a helper or hooks class.
* Never issue CUDA work, or hold something that can, from the control plane.
* Never synchronize with the device from the data plane's per-round path;
  run with `TOKENSPEED_DATA_PLANE_SYNC_DEBUG=error` while developing on it.
* L3 `batch_exists` registration is on the admit path, but only when
  `--kvstore-storage-backend` is set. Hashing every admitted prefix on the
  default (`--disable-kvstore`) path is a control-plane cost the loop must
  not pay: a round is microseconds, and agentic history is tens of thousands
  of tokens. When L3 is on, existence is MIN-reduced across every
  cache-owning rank in the replica (attention TP, then CP, then PP) so
  those ranks admit the same prefix pages. L2 ``WriteBackDone`` /
  ``LoadBackDone`` completions are intersected the same way before
  ``CompleteWriteBack``: L3 Host backups finish asynchronously, so a
  rank-local ACK would publish a Host block on one mirrored scheduler
  while a CP/PP peer still has the op pending. A backup future that
  fails is MAX-reduced on the same replica all_reduce that agrees
  whether any rank has cache work; every rank raises after that
  collective instead of one rank raising out of ``poll_results`` while
  peers wait in ``all_gather_object``. Every rank stays in every
  replica-group gather, even when an earlier TP/CP intersection is empty;
  breaking out leaves a peer unmatched on the next ``all_gather_object``.
  Weight-update `flush_cache` and standalone `/flush_cache` first
  MAX-reduce flush intent across attention DP so every DP worker enters
  the same collectives — the frontend sends `FlushCacheReqInput`
  separately, and a rank that reduced inside request handling would wait
  on a peer still in `_dp_sync_and_check`. They then MIN-reduce a
  non-mutating `can_clear_cache` probe across the replica (attention TP,
  then CP, then PP) and then across attention DP — DP replicas share
  Mooncake objects — then MIN-reduce an error-returning L3
  `remove_by_prefix`, before any rank mutates Device/Host. The frontend
  ANDs every DP worker's reply. Independent TokenSpeed jobs that share a
  tenant are not in those groups. Queued Submitted/Retracted
  hashes of requests that can take a batch slot and Device pages this
  round are re-probed immediately before `next_execution_plan` so a hit
  registered at submit cannot be admitted after the object is gone. A
  full decode batch, a head-of-line incomplete prefill, or an exhausted
  Device pool skips the rest of the wait queue so a long prompt is not
  hashed and remotely probed on every token step.
  `ENABLE_CP` without PP fans `recv_reqs` across the CP group (only
  `cp_rank==0` owns the ZMQ PULL and load reporting) so every cache-owning
  rank enters the same exists MIN; PP already fans the stream across WORLD.
  After Admit, vanished L3 objects are recovered on the same path:
  control-plane `batch_get_into`, replica MIN, skip H2D / skip
  publishing empty Host pages and empty Device prefetch destinations,
  snapshot-less retract of the batch so the next admit recomputes.
  D-role admit rides `plan.remote_prefill` with no local forward: those
  request ids retract with the same events, and the loop withholds that
  stream from `DeviceHandle.execute` so the peer does not land
  suffix-only KV on empty prefix pages. Cache ops still run so
  LoadBackDone can unpin without publishing.
  Failed `batch_get_into` pages stay unread so a later `batch_exists` hit
  cannot re-register them; only the replica-converged misses are
  blacklisted, so a restored prefix page stays readable. Replica
  admission MIN-reduces local readability (exists and not unread). A
  later Host backup forgets an unread entry only when it created a
  missing object; a create-only skip of an unreadable object keeps the
  blacklist. The unread set is bounded to Host CacheBlock capacity
  (LCM parents times each group's `cache_blocks_per_lcm_block`). A backend
  exception or malformed existence / prefetch result is a local miss so
  every cache-owning rank still enters the replica MIN; raising would
  hang healthy peers. Clients are not failed.
