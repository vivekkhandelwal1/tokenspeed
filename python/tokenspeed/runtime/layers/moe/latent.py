    * Lane hit: the partials were produced straight into one packed buffer.
      Batch 1 uses the persistent fused lane. CDNA5 decode up to 32 tokens
      uses the same layout so the join copy is not launched. One one-shot
      reduce follows, with a norm epilogue when that collective accepts the
      row count. The collective still stages the buffer.
    * Small partials: cat into one contiguous operand and take a single
      one-shot reduce; the copy is a couple of microseconds there.
    * Partials past the one-shot window (prefill-sized chunks): the cat would
      copy a few hundred MB per layer just to feed one NCCL call, while a

class Kimi3LatentProjection(ReplicatedLinear):
    """Latent projection with kernel-owned specialization.

    Tuned shapes use registered accelerator kernels. Other shapes retain the
    ordinary dense projection without requiring model-side shape selection.

    With ``shard_group`` the output dimension is partitioned across the group
    (column parallel): each rank stores ``output_size / tp`` rows of the weight
    and the ordinary projection ends with one all-gather. K3's tail paths avoid
    that gather: the fused multicast tail consumes the shard directly, while
    the other tiers inject each rank's column block into a reduction they
    already run. Thus every tail retains ``(tp-1)/tp`` of the weight's memory
    savings without adding collective wire bytes.

    With ``multicast_down`` the projection instead takes a column shard that
    publishes each rank's block into every peer's mailbox, which keeps each
    output element computed on one rank and so leaves the numerics untouched.
    It covers the widths the op claims -- the decode graph's captures.

    With ``column_group`` the projection splits the same output columns over
    the group and one all-gather concatenates the blocks. It is taken only
    where a mailbox exists, which is to say only where the fabric can map
    symmetric memory, and it narrows storage the same way ``shard_group``
    does. That coupling is deliberate, and measured rather than inferred: the
    replica wins at every width where the fabric cannot carry the gather. The
    numbers are on ``_gather_shards``, which is where the two routes are
    described together; they are not repeated here because an earlier eager
    set that was repriced away lived in this paragraph, two decimal places
    from a value in the other arm.

    Where the fabric is there, the split pays from the mailbox ceiling
    upward: measured on GB300 TP8 under graph replay with cold weights, the
    shard wins from 1280 by about 5 percent out to 36 at 8192, and the
    fused NVLink gather writes the final layout for 135us where the buffer
    path needs 239us. It wins eager as well -- 64.3/53.8 at 2048, 101.8/78.7
    at 4096, 208.9/138.6 at 8192 -- so the width does not depend on whether
    the chunk was captured, and a deployment whose chunks exceed the capture
    ceiling needs nothing done here.

    ``get_is_cuda_graph_phase`` cannot decide those two regimes apart, which
    is worth knowing because it reads as though it could. Its only setters
    are the decode wrapper's capture and its comm prewarm, and the executor
    runs prefill capture as a later statement, after that capture has
    already restored the flag -- so it is False throughout prefill capture.
    Nothing here keys on it, and nothing should.

        ``all_gather_inner`` -- the fused NVLink gather writes the final layout
        in one pass, 135us at 8152 tokens where a buffer-and-permute needs 239.

        It reaches that kernel only on NVIDIA, with a 2-D bf16 tensor gathered
        on the last dim; anything else, and any group the fabric cannot map,
        falls back to the NCCL backend's allocate-gather-transpose, and that
        fallback loses to the replica at every width. Measured under graph
        replay on 8 ranks over two hosts, with the route witnessed rather than
        assumed -- nccl 33 calls and rsag 0 with the probe declined, the
        reverse with it live:

            m       no fabric (nccl)      with fabric (rsag)
            1280    37.2 rep / 76.8 col   37.7 rep / 35.6 col
            4096   111.4     / 121.5     111.5     /  72.6
            8192   226.0     / 254.0     224.5     / 142.8

        Which is why a projection that cannot narrow does not take this route
        at all. An earlier eager measurement here put the no-fabric gap at
        4.5x rather than 2.1x; it timed host submission inside the interval,
        and the two arms submit different amounts of Python.

        Returns:
            The full-width projection. **It may alias the backend's workspace**,
            which the next gather reuses -- measured same-address across
            consecutive calls. Read it on the issuing stream before gathering
            again. The contract is stated for both routes even though only the
            column one can alias, because a caller that had to know which route
            it got would be the branch this method exists to remove.
