"""Kimi-K3 communication layer: capability negotiation and fused-reduction
routing for the sites where K3's AttnRes/latent-lane semantics bypass the
generic ``CommManager`` (decision D4).

Layering: this module owns *which backend runs where* (votes, workspace
lifecycle, M-window routing); the kernels themselves stay behind
``tokenspeed_kernel.ops.communication`` / ``ops.moe``. Model code
(``kimi_k3.py``) states semantics only and never names a backend.

All M thresholds for the K3 tail live here (single source of truth):

======================  =========================================

        Measured net faster despite the extra launch at the width that
        actually reaches it -- one token per step, where every layer but the
        block-write ones arrives with a residual. Wider steps mostly take the
        fused AttnRes graph instead, and the block-write layers that still
        arrive pass no prefix: instrumented at eight tokens on a DSpark
        deployment, this window was armed and served nothing. A layer that
        declines the fused graph for some other reason does reach it with a
        prefix, so that is a property of the configuration, not of the width.

        Like the vendor branch below it, that window does not consult
        ``force_deterministic_rsag``: the collective reduces in ascending rank
        order with an fp32 accumulator, so it is already run-to-run stable.

        ``mlp_wp`` is the calling layer's precomputed ``rms_w * res_w``
        product (per-layer state, filled in post_load_weights); the B1
