# CI Task Specs

`test/ci/` is the source of truth for CI task declarations consumed by
`test/ci_system/pipeline.py`.

Current trigger values:

- `per-commit`
- `manual`
- `nightly`
- `debug`
- `slurm`

Supported task types:

- `ut`
- `server_smoke`
- `eval`
- `perf`

Currently configured task directories:

- `eval`
- `perf`
- `ut`

Every task declares one `workflow_stage`:

- `unit-test` for kernel and runtime tests
- `kernel-benchmark` for registration-level kernel performance tests
- `model-test` for model evaluation and performance tests

The NVIDIA PR workflows run unit tests before model tests. The normal AMD flow
runs unit tests, then kernel benchmarks, then model tests. Matrix entries within
each stage run in parallel. A stage with no matching tasks is treated as
successfully satisfied.

PRs labeled `high priority` start `unit-test` and `model-test` concurrently.
Applying the label starts a new CI run immediately and cancels the older run
through the workflow's concurrency policy. A unit-test failure does not cancel
model tests that are already running in this mode. AMD kernel benchmarks retain
their normal unit-test dependency.

The Qwen3.5 FP8 DeepEP correctness task runs GSM8K on four B200 GPUs with
attention TP2, attention DP2, and MoE EP4. DeepEP `auto` mode exercises its
normal path during prefill and low-latency path during decode, and the task
uses the bounded non-thinking chat template for CI stability. The task requires
a score of at least 0.90. After installation, it imports `tokenspeed_kernel` on
GPU before launching the model, so incompatible native wheels fail at the
installation stage. This GPU check is kept outside the general installer,
which also runs during image builds without GPU access.

The Qwen3.8 Flash Next FP8 correctness task runs GSM8K on two GB200 GPUs with
tensor parallelism 2 and three-step MTP. It keeps KVStore enabled and uses the
bounded non-thinking chat template for CI stability. The task requires a score
of at least 0.96.

The long-context performance report accepts both current EvalScope metrics
(`Avg TPOT (ms)`, `Avg Decoded Tok/Iter`) and their older names. Missing or
invalid TPOT fails collection instead of producing a zero-throughput report.
Unavailable acceptance metrics appear as `N/A` (empty CSV cells); an aggregate
is unavailable if any run for that prompt length lacks the metric.

Each task expands into one matrix entry per runner label. Add a top-level
`priority` to a task YAML to bias dispatch order. GitHub Actions starts matrix
jobs in include-list order, so `high` entries reach a contended runner pool
before `normal` (the default) and `low`. Tasks that omit `priority` keep their
original ordering.

`priority` accepts either a scalar (applies to every label of the task) or a
per-label mapping (only the listed labels are overridden; every other label
stays at `normal`):

```yaml
# whole task at high
priority: high

# only the b300-1gpu instance drops to low; h100-1gpu / b200-1gpu / ...
# of the same task keep the default normal
priority:
  b300-1gpu: low
```

Typical use: adjust one runner instance without disturbing the same task's
dispatch order on other GPU families. Priority only affects jobs within the
same workflow stage; it does not change dependencies between stages.

`retries` (eval/perf only) is a non-negative integer: the pipeline restarts the
managed server and reruns later stages that many extra times after a crash or
score miss. Use it for infrastructure flakes (CUDA launch failure, NVLink
barrier timeout, GPU memory-access fault) where a clean second attempt is
cheap relative to a red PR.

The AMD Kimi-K2.5 AIME25, NVIDIA Kimi-K2.5 EAGLE3 AIME25, and B200 GLM-5.2
AIME26 gates write EvalScope results under
`.ci-artifacts/published/evalscope-results`. Their CI artifact upload runs on
both success and failure, including timestamped per-question predictions and
scoring records. Compare the
responses, stop reasons, and extracted answers when investigating an accuracy
miss before changing the token limit or sampling configuration.

The NVIDIA Kimi-K2.5 EAGLE3 AIME25 gate allows `max_tokens=131072` within a
262138-token context. EAGLE3 with one speculative step uses two draft tokens;
its three overlap spans reserve six positions below the model's 262144-token
limit. A fixed-version diagnostic reproduced a 65536-token
truncation; with the larger budget, the identical generated prefix continued
to a correct answer and stopped naturally at 70332 tokens. This single-question
result motivates the budget; the full 30-question gate still requires 0.93
accuracy with batch size 16 and greedy sampling. EvalScope records are saved
under `.ci-artifacts/published/evalscope-results` on success and failure.

The AMD Kimi-K2.5 AIME25 gate allows `max_tokens=65536`, matching the NVIDIA
Kimi-K2.5 DFlash task. The same question was truncated in both the
[8K run](https://github.com/lightseekorg/tokenspeed/actions/runs/34763795877) and
[16K run](https://github.com/lightseekorg/tokenspeed/actions/runs/34764637152).
With the larger budget, the [64K run](https://github.com/lightseekorg/tokenspeed/actions/runs/34765831078)
completed all four answers correctly with natural stops; the longest used 41181
output tokens. The four questions, batch size four, greedy sampling, EAGLE3
configuration, score threshold of 0.75, and timeouts remain unchanged.

`optional` marks a task or per-label matrix entry as non-blocking.
Optional entries are emitted with `matrix.optional: true`, and the PR workflows
map that to GitHub Actions `continue-on-error`.

```yaml
# whole task can fail without blocking the workflow
optional: true

# only the MI355 bench entry is non-blocking; the MI350 entry of the same
# task still blocks on failure
optional:
  amd-mi355-1gpu-bench: true
```

The NVIDIA PR workflow routes `b200-<Ngpu>` task labels to
`b200v2-<Ngpu>` by default. Set the `TOKENSPEED_B200_RUNNER_LABEL` repository
variable in GitHub Actions (`Settings` -> `Secrets and variables` -> `Actions`
-> `Variables`) to a non-empty runner family, such as `b200`, to override the
default without editing task YAML.

Only `b200v2-*` jobs enable a persistent, node-local package cache. They reuse
pip downloads from `/raid/cache/pip` and explicitly downloaded release wheels
from `/raid/cache/wheelhouse`; when `FLASHINFER_CACHE_DIR` points elsewhere,
the two directories are created beside that cache instead. This survives
runner pod recreation and avoids downloading the same large wheels again on
that node. Other runner families keep their existing cache behavior because
their cluster storage layouts may differ.

CI runner images are expected to provide `ninja`. Runner setup checks for the
executable and only refreshes apt metadata and installs `ninja-build` when it is
missing. This keeps source checkouts independently installable without making
every ephemeral GPU runner wait on package mirrors before installation.

For model evaluation and performance jobs, the reusable PR task workflow puts
uv's cache in `.uv-cache` under the job's work directory, overriding an inherited
shared uv cache. The existing always-run work-directory cleanup removes this
general task cache on success or failure. EvalScope downloads use the dedicated
`HF_HOME/.uv-cache/evalscope` namespace when a runner provides `HF_HOME`, or an
explicit `EVALSCOPE_UV_CACHE_DIR` override. Only the `eval.install` and
`perf.install` stages use this cache, so every job still creates a clean virtual
environment. Runners without either location continue using the disposable job
cache. Unit-test, kernel benchmark, pip, and release-wheel caches retain their
existing policy.

Accuracy jobs also keep Triton's compiled kernels in `.triton-cache` under their
work directory. Lazy compilation during a request can then write its cache even
when the runner's shared `/cache/triton` volume is full. The directory survives
the task's server restarts and is removed by the same job cleanup; compiler
options and test workloads are unchanged. Performance jobs retain the runner's
Triton cache policy so cold compilation is not newly introduced into measured
requests.

The AMD Kimi-K3 EAGLE3 performance task publishes its EvalScope outputs and
tokenizer under
`.ci-artifacts/published/kimi-k3-eagle3-tp8ep1-50k-500-perf`, including the
request/response database. These artifacts allow input, output, and speculative
acceptance differences to be investigated alongside timing changes. The task
measures 16 concurrent 50K-input/500-output requests with TP8/EP1 and zero
benchmark warmup requests.

The corresponding AMD Kimi-K3 EAGLE3 AIME26 gate publishes its per-question
predictions and scoring records under
`.ci-artifacts/published/kimi-k3-eagle3-aime26`. This retains evidence for accuracy
misses without changing the full 30-question workload, generation settings, or
score threshold.

The AMD DeepSeek-V4.1-Flash GSM8K task downloads its weights into
`.hf-model-cache` in the job's work directory. Its uncached checkpoint can exceed
the remaining capacity of the shared model volume; the job filesystem provides
separate writable storage, cleaned up with the work directory. The model ID,
precision, evaluation workload, and score threshold stay the same. This task
downloads a fresh checkpoint for each job, so startup includes the download time.

The same model jobs isolate MIOpen's writable user database and kernel cache
under `.miopen-db` and `.miopen-kernels` in their work directory. This avoids
SQLite I/O failures from a runner's shared cache. MIOpen's system database and
tuning settings remain unchanged; the job cleanup removes the writable caches.

The MI450 simulator launcher sets `TRITON_LIBHIP_PATH` to the ROCm SDK's
unversioned `libamdhip64.so` linker name. The gfx1250 PyTorch wheel and
TokenSpeed use separate Triton distributions in the same process, and this
path is accepted by both while still resolving to the same TheRock runtime.

To enable `push` and `workflow_dispatch` runs of the three PR test workflows
outside the official repository, set the `TOKENSPEED_CI_REPOSITORY` repository
variable at the same settings path to the configured repository's exact
`owner/repo` name. The official
`lightseekorg/tokenspeed` repository remains enabled without this variable.
Leave it unset or empty to keep push/manual GPU CI disabled in other
repositories. `pull_request` runs keep their existing behavior. The configured
repository must also provide the matching self-hosted runner labels and any
required secrets; this variable only controls the repository gate.

The NVIDIA PR workflow excludes `h100` and `b300` runners by default, including
for fork PRs where repository variables are unavailable. To temporarily remove
additional unavailable GPU runners from PR test matrices, set the
`TOKENSPEED_CI_EXCLUDED_RUNNER_LABELS` repository variable to comma-separated,
case-insensitive substrings such as `gb200, mi355`. Matching uses the resolved
runner label after applying `TOKENSPEED_B200_RUNNER_LABEL`; `mi355` therefore
matches `amd-mi355-*`. Empty entries are ignored. If every runner in a workflow
group is excluded, its matrix job is skipped while the workflow still
finishes. This variable applies only to the three PR test workflows. Clear or
unset it to restore all runner labels except the NVIDIA workflow's `h100` and
`b300` baselines.

The CI system derives `SM` from common runner label prefixes by default:
`h100`/`h200` use `sm90`, `b200`/`gb200` use `sm100`, and `b300`/`gb300` use
`sm103`. Use `runner.env.<label>` only for environment variables that should
override or extend the defaults for a single runner label.

PR workflows split runner labels by vendor and host architecture. `PR Test
NVIDIA` uses the `nvidia-x86` runner group, while `PR Test NVIDIA ARM` uses
the `nvidia-arm` runner group. GB300 is classified as NVIDIA ARM, but is not
declared in task YAMLs and therefore does not enter default CI matrices.

### Vendor path filtering

Each vendor PR workflow starts with a `scan` job that classifies the changed
files with `test/ci_system/ci_path_filter.py --runner-group <group>` and skips
its GPU matrix jobs when nothing requires that runner group. The first
matching rule decides (`ci_path_filter.py` holds the full lists):

* Markdown files require no runner group.
* Vendor-owned paths (`tokenspeed-kernel-amd/`, `tokenspeed-mla/`, the
  `tokenspeed-kernel/test/<vendor>/` subtrees, and vendor-specific requirements
  and CI scripts) require only that vendor's runner groups.
* Kernel sources are classified by solution name: `cuda`, `cute_dsl`,
  `flashinfer`, `deep_gemm`, `trtllm`, etc. are NVIDIA; `gluon` is AMD. A
  vendor-named file whose content mentions another vendor stays shared.
* `test/ci` task YAMLs require only the runner groups matching their
  `runner.labels`.
* Other paths under `python/`, `test/`, `tokenspeed-kernel/`, and
  `tokenspeed-scheduler/` require every runner group.
* Each workflow's own YAML requires only its runner group; `workflow_dispatch`
  always runs.

PR and push diffs containing only `test/ci/**/*.yaml` run only the changed tasks,
with existing validation and runner/trigger rules. Mixed, empty, or potentially
truncated diffs (300+ paths) keep the existing scope. Manual and nightly runs
retain their existing task selection.

`tokenspeed-kernel/test/` is laid out to feed the vendor rules. Tests whose
module-level gate (`is_cdna4()`, `is_cdna5()`, `is_amd()`, or an import from
`tokenspeed_kernel_amd`) skips them off AMD hardware live under
`tokenspeed-kernel/test/amd/`; tests that require CUDA, CuTe DSL, FlashInfer,
DeepEP, DeepGEMM, TRT-LLM, FlashAttention 3/4, FlashMLA, Marlin, MNNVL, or
`tokenspeed-mla` live under `tokenspeed-kernel/test/nvidia/`. Everything else
(portable Triton kernels, registry and selection logic, tests that
parametrize over both vendors) stays at the top level. The vendor subtrees
mirror the top-level `ops/` and `thirdparty/` layout, and every subtree shares
the root `conftest.py`, `utils.py`, and `kimi3_reference.py`, so a test moves
between them without changing its imports. Put a new test in the narrowest
directory whose gate matches its module-level skip; a mixed test belongs at
the top level rather than in either vendor subtree.

## Registration-Level Kernel Benchmarks

The `kernel-benchmark-amd-gfx950` performance task compares exact kernel
registrations between two revisions. `PR Test AMD` discovers it as a dedicated
`kernel-benchmark` stage. In the normal flow, it runs after unit tests and must
succeed before model tests can start. The high-priority model path remains eager
and does not wait for either stage. All stages contribute to the workflow's final
status.

Pull request runs compare the pull request's merge base with its head commit.
Main-branch pushes compare the previous and new commits. A manual `PR Test AMD`
run uses its selected commit for both sides as a runner smoke test. For a
meaningful manual comparison, use `K8s Dispatch`: selecting a pull request uses
its target and head revisions, while selecting a commit compares it with the
latest `main`. Both revisions always execute serially in one task allocation.

The task requests the `amd-mi355-1gpu-bench` runner pool and exposes logical
device 0. Each allocation must provide one exclusive `gfx950` GPU, working ROCm
device permissions, Git, Bash, Python virtual-environment support, sufficient
temporary storage, and access to the configured package indexes. The normal AMD
task executor provides runner cleanup and setup before invoking the benchmark.

The coordinator creates independent worktrees and Python environments inside
that allocation. Each revision installs its own ROCm kernel requirements and
uses isolated compilation caches. A benchmark fails only when it exceeds both
its merge-base relative and absolute regression limits. Noisy measurements and
successful added, changed, or missing cases remain informational. Correctness,
execution, environment, and infrastructure failures fail the task.

The shared task executor uploads the task result and the benchmark's published
comparison in one Actions artifact. A separate `AMD Kernel Benchmark PR
Comment` workflow runs trusted code from the default branch after `PR Test AMD`
finishes. It validates the untrusted artifact and source revision before
creating or replacing one bot-owned comment. Runs where the benchmark task was
not selected have no report and are ignored.

A merge base that does not contain the suite yields a candidate-only
bootstrap instead of a comparison. Changes to the comment workflow take effect
only after they merge, since `workflow_run` workflows execute from the default
branch. Manual runs produce summaries and artifacts but not pull request
comments.

`CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0` does not limit the shared cleanup process scan, so the
runner must provide scheduler-enforced GPU or process-namespace isolation. The
runner fleet must prevent two jobs from sharing one physical GPU.

Harness, suite, correctness, timing, and local reproduction details are in the
[kernel benchmark documentation](../../tokenspeed-kernel/benchmarks/README.md).

## Slurm with Pyxis/Enroot

`slurm_submit.py` submits an existing task YAML without copying its server,
evaluation, performance, or threshold configuration into a second format. It
targets one task at a time. By default the task uses one node, and the GPU count
comes from the selected runner label, such as `gb200-4gpu`.

An eval or perf task can request multiple nodes with an explicit topology:

```yaml
triggers: [slurm]
runner:
  labels: [slurm-gb200-4node-4gpu]
slurm:
  nodes: 4
  gpus_per_node: 4
```

Multi-node tasks must use exactly one of the `nightly`, `per-commit`, or `slurm`
triggers and a `slurm-*` runner label, so only their dedicated workflow or the
manual Slurm dispatcher can select them. The GPU count in the label must equal
`slurm.gpus_per_node`.

For a multi-node task, the generated batch script extracts the committed source
snapshot into a server workspace on every node and a separate client workspace
on the first node. It starts one containerized server task per node, then runs
the readiness probe plus eval/perf stages in the first node's client workspace.
Keeping the workspaces separate prevents concurrent install stages from writing
the same source tree. The server command is identical on every node. TokenSpeed derives
`nnodes`, `node_rank`, and the rendezvous address from the Slurm step variables;
do not add those flags to the task's server command. When the client step exits,
the script terminates the server step and removes each node's local snapshot.

The submitter expects Pyxis/Enroot support in Slurm. Before submission it
archives the clean, committed `HEAD` into the artifact root. The compute node
extracts that immutable snapshot under `SLURM_TMPDIR` and mounts it at
`/workspace`, so the checkout itself does not need to be shared. The artifact
root, cache directory, and any additional host mounts do need to be visible at
the same paths on the login and compute nodes. The default container is the
NVIDIA release image
`docker.io#lightseekorg/tokenspeed:<version>`, where `<version>` is read from
`python/pyproject.toml`. Override it with `--container-image` when testing a
different build. The container needs Python and pip. If PyYAML is absent, the
job installs `PyYAML>=6,<7` into its job-local `/tmp` before starting the
pipeline; images that already provide PyYAML do not perform this bootstrap.

The generated `sbatch` command uses `/tmp` as its working directory because the
login-node checkout may not be mounted on compute nodes. Override it with
`--sbatch-workdir` only when the selected path is compute-node-visible.

By default, the task's top-level `install` stage runs so a runner/base image
tests the exact committed checkout. Task-specific `eval.install` and
`perf.install` stages run afterward. Use `--skip-install` only with a release
image that already contains the intended TokenSpeed build.

The install stage picks up `tokenspeed-mla` from the snapshot only when the
dispatching workflow sets `INSTALL_TOKENSPEED_MLA_FROM_SOURCE=1`, which the
per-commit workflow derives from the diff and the manual dispatcher sets for any
requested pull request. The generated `srun` steps name that variable in
`--container-env` so it reaches the install stage. Without it the job tests the
`tokenspeed-mla` wheel pinned in
`tokenspeed-kernel/python/requirements/cuda-thirdparty.txt`; that pin and the
in-tree package carry the same version, so pip keeps the wheel and an unreleased
in-tree kernel change never runs.

The job gets the node exclusively by default so another job cannot contend for
its GPU or fixed service ports. `--no-exclusive` opts out. Runtime cleanup is
scoped to the Slurm job and never kills unrelated listeners on the node.

Render the exact `sbatch` command and job script without submitting:

```bash
python3 test/ci_system/slurm_submit.py \
  --config test/ci/eval/qwen3.5-397b-a17b-nvfp4-dp4ep4-evalscope-aime25.yaml \
  --partition batch \
  --render
```

Rendering a multi-node config also validates the two-step orchestration without
allocating nodes. The output should contain a four-node `sbatch`, a server
`srun` with one task per node, and a one-node client `srun` with `--relative=0`.

Submit the same evaluation and follow its output:

```bash
python3 test/ci_system/slurm_submit.py \
  --config test/ci/eval/qwen3.5-397b-a17b-nvfp4-dp4ep4-evalscope-aime25.yaml \
  --partition batch \
  --cache-dir /mnt/lustre01/$USER/tokenspeed-cache \
  --pass-env HF_TOKEN \
  --follow
```

Submit every eval/perf YAML that declares an exact runner label:

```bash
python3 test/ci_system/slurm_submit.py \
  --all \
  --runner gb200-4gpu \
  --partition batch \
  --cache-dir /mnt/lustre01/$USER/tokenspeed-cache
```

`--trigger manual` (or another trigger) optionally narrows `--all`. All
matching tasks are submitted before `--follow` starts, so their Slurm jobs can
run concurrently.

On a Slurm coordinator, use the shell launcher for manual scheduling. It
supplies the cluster's shared artifact/cache paths and pinned runner image.
The defaults target GB200; on GB300 set the shared paths under
`/data/home/$USER`:

```bash
TS_CI_ARTIFACT_ROOT=/data/home/$USER/tokenspeed-slurm \
TS_CI_CACHE_DIR=/data/home/$USER/tokenspeed-cache \
TS_CI_LOCAL_MODEL_ROOT=/scratch/$USER-models \
test/ci/run_slurm.sh \
  test/ci/eval/kimi-k3-mxfp4-tp8-two-node-evalscope-aime26-gb300-slurm.yaml \
  --runner slurm-gb300-4gpu \
  --type eval \
  --wait
```

GB300 server containers mount `TS_CI_LOCAL_MODEL_ROOT` read-only at `/models`.
It defaults to `/scratch/$USER-models`, the node-local RAID path. The Kimi-K3
GB300 tasks use pinned snapshots below that mount so weight loading does not
read the shared Hugging Face cache. Synchronize these directories to every
eligible GB300 node before enabling the tasks:

### B300 DeepSWE

`B300 DeepSWE` is a manual, single-node 8-GPU workflow for Kimi K3. It starts
the local `/raid/cache/jue/kimi-k3-flat2` checkpoint, then runs Kimi Code
0.23.6 inside the pinned DeepSWE v1.1 Docker tasks through Pier 0.3.1. The
default smoke run selects the same deterministic 10-task subset (`seed=0`);
the workflow also exposes one-task bring-up and the full 113-task corpus.

The repository-scoped `b300deepswe-8gpu` runner is isolated from the normal
B300 pools and mounts the host Docker socket. The workflow definition is loaded
only from `main` and rejects fork pull requests. An optional pull request input
may select code only from a branch in this repository. Keep the workflow manual
unless the runner is moved behind an approval environment.
The preflight fails if an out-of-cluster Docker workload is already using the
GPUs, because Kubernetes cannot account for those allocations.

Pier's restricted egress proxy permits the agent to reach only the runner Pod
IP on HTTP port 80. Kimi Code receives the local Tokenspeed endpoint through
`KIMI_MODEL_*`; task containers retain DeepSWE's `no-network` policy. The
workflow fails on incomplete/error trials and optionally on a binary-reward
minimum. The default minimum is zero because a 10-task sample is not a stable
regression threshold.

The `Slurm Dispatch` workflow exposes a `cluster` input. `gb200` keeps the
existing `slurm-dispatch` coordinator and runner defaults. Selecting `gb300`
with every other input left at its default keeps the same logical B200/GB200
tasks and filters, but maps their runner labels to the matching `gb300-Ngpu`
hardware. A selected YAML follows the same rule; YAMLs that already declare a
`gb300-Ngpu` or `slurm-gb300-Ngpu` label pass it through unchanged. Five
`slurm-dispatch-gb300` coordinators form one shared pool for manual, nightly,
and per-commit submissions.

The `GB200` workflow runs single-node `slurm-gb200-*`
tasks through the `slurm-dispatch` coordinator. Qwen four-GPU tasks migrated
from B200 use `slurm-gb200-4gpu`: the 397B NVFP4 AIME25 evaluation, 35B FP8
DeepEP GSM8K evaluation, and 122B EPD OCRBench evaluation and unit test.
Their existing commands, triggers, and score thresholds are preserved.

It runs automatically for relevant pushes to `main` and non-draft,
same-repository pull requests; manual dispatch selects the `manual` trigger.
The ordinary NVIDIA ARM workflow excludes `slurm-*` tasks. The dedicated
Slurm scan clears `TOKENSPEED_CI_EXCLUDED_RUNNER_LABELS`, so the Kubernetes
`gb200` exclusion does not disable these tasks. Closing a PR cancels its run;
the approved-PR and latest-main retry workflows also cover this workflow.

`Slurm Dispatch` includes `slurm-gb200-4gpu` in its default bulk runners.
Its default `eval,perf` selection covers the three migrated evaluations;
select `ut` explicitly to include the EPD unit test.

The `GB300` workflow selects only multi-node model tasks with
the `per-commit` trigger and submits them through the same
`slurm-dispatch-gb300` coordinator pool used by manual dispatch. It runs for
pushes to `main` and for non-draft pull requests whose head branch belongs to
this repository. Pull-request runs execute the merge commit's dispatcher, so
dispatcher changes are covered before merge. Fork pull requests remain skipped
until the coordinator pool uses ephemeral runners with a protected approval
environment; use the manual `Slurm Dispatch` workflow after review. New commits
cancel the older run for the same pull request or the `main` branch.

Submission is fail-closed and requires the repository variable
`TOKENSPEED_CI_GB300_SLURM_PER_COMMIT_ENABLED` to equal `true`. The dedicated
switch is separate from `TOKENSPEED_CI_EXCLUDED_RUNNER_LABELS`: this workflow
does not pass that variable to its matrix scan, so entries such as `gb300`
cannot filter the multi-node matrix here. During this workflow's
bootstrap only, leave the switch unset; after dispatcher support reaches
`main`, set it to `true` and re-run the merge commit's workflow.

`Retry Failed Latest Main CI` also covers `GB300`. Its hourly
or manual scan retries failed jobs from completed, failed push runs on the
latest `main` commit, using the original run and commit. The retry workflow
stops after three total attempts (the original plus two retries); older
commits are skipped.

The `GB300 Slurm Nightly` workflow runs every day at 18:17 UTC and can also be
started manually from `main`. It selects only multi-node model tests with the
`nightly` trigger, then restricts the generated matrix to `slurm-gb300-*`
runners before submitting through the GB300 coordinator pool. The runner filter
keeps future GB200 nightly tasks out of the GB300 workflow. Submission is
fail-closed until `TOKENSPEED_CI_GB300_SLURM_NIGHTLY_ENABLED` is set to `true`;
this switch is independent of the per-commit workflow's enable variable.

The two-node Kimi K3 tasks declare `slurm-gb300-4gpu`, `slurm.nodes: 2`, and
`slurm.gpus_per_node: 4`. The runner label describes GPUs per node, while the
Slurm topology fields describe the allocation. The NVFP4 DSpark task pairs the
pinned `nvidia/Kimi-K3-NVFP4` target with `Inferact/Kimi-K3-DSpark` and
preserves the draft checkpoint's required `attn_res` auxiliary stream.
The MXFP4 DSpark OCRBench and MMMU-Pro Vision tasks are nightly baselines that
use a pinned Kimi Vendor Verifier revision. Either YAML can still be rerun
explicitly through `Slurm Dispatch` with the `gb300` cluster.

This is a manual launcher, not a GitHub Actions runner. Override its defaults
with `TS_CI_ARTIFACT_ROOT`, `TS_CI_CACHE_DIR`, or
`TS_CI_CONTAINER_IMAGE`.

The default Slurm image pins Torch 2.14.0 and FlashInfer 0.7.0 by image digest.
Keep the FlashInfer Python requirement, release cubin checksum, and runner
JIT-cache version aligned when upgrading. FlashInfer 0.7.0 also requires
cuDNN frontend 1.29.0 or newer and splits its JIT cache into provider packages.
GB200/B200 setup resolves those providers from the matching FlashInfer CUDA
index and checks their installed versions again after dependency installation.

`--pr` accepts a pull request number or GitHub URL. It fetches the PR head and
merges it into the launcher's committed `HEAD` in an isolated temporary
worktree. The original checkout is not modified, and submitted jobs use an
immutable archive of that merged commit. A merge conflict stops before any job
is submitted.

Concurrent submissions publish each commit's snapshot without replacing an
existing archive. Reuse requires byte-for-byte agreement with a fresh Git
archive; a mismatched snapshot fails submission and is left unchanged.

`--source-pr` accepts the same values but only labels the report; it neither
fetches nor merges, and is for callers that already checked out the pull
request's merge commit.

Repeat `--runner` to select multiple exact labels. Repeat `--type` to select
from `ut`, `server_smoke`, `eval`, and `perf`; without `--type`, the
backward-compatible default is `eval` plus `perf`. Repeat `--match` to select
tasks whose name, YAML path, server command, or selected task command contains
any supplied substring (case-insensitive). `--list` prints the final matrix
without creating snapshots or submitting jobs, while `--render` prints the
generated Slurm commands and scripts.

`--wait` keeps the dispatcher process alive until every submitted Slurm job
reaches a terminal state. `--report-dir PATH` then collects a `manifest.json`,
Markdown summary, per-job logs, and available `result.json` files under
`PATH`. The command succeeds only when every job reaches `COMPLETED`. SIGINT or
SIGTERM while waiting calls `scancel` for the jobs submitted by that command.

The manual `Slurm Dispatch` GitHub workflow runs on the organization runner
with the `slurm-dispatch` label. That runner belongs on the Slurm coordinator and
only needs GitHub runner prerequisites, this repository, Python/PyYAML, and
Slurm client commands; it does not need GPUs. Leaving the PR input blank checks
out the exact commit selected by the workflow's branch/ref; selecting `main`
tests its commit at dispatch time. Otherwise the requested PR is merged into a
trusted `main` checkout. From the Actions UI, optionally provide a PR,
comma-separated runner labels and task types, and an optional comma-separated
task/model filter. The workflow submits the selected matrix, waits for all
jobs, writes the aggregate table to the GitHub step summary, and uploads the
collected report directory as an artifact. It excludes long-running MMLU tasks
by default; explicitly enable `include_mmlu` in the manual workflow inputs when
that coverage is required.

The optional `container_image` input overrides the trusted dispatcher's default
for validating a new runner image before it becomes the default. It accepts
only digest-pinned `ghcr.io/lightseekorg/tokenspeed-runner` images; mutable tags
and images from other registries or organizations are rejected.

The `yaml` input is `off` by default. Select one listed CI YAML to run that YAML
independently of the bulk runner, type, match, trigger, and MMLU filters. On
GB200, every B200 or GB200 runner label declared by the selected YAML is
submitted as its own Slurm job. On GB300, those logical labels are submitted on
the corresponding GB300 runner; native GB300 labels are submitted unchanged.

To test a same-repository branch without opening a PR, leave `pr` blank:

```bash
gh workflow run slurm-dispatch.yml --ref <branch> -f cluster=gb200
```

The Slurm wrapper defaults to the digest-pinned Torch 2.14 / CUDA 13.0 runner
image. The install stage checks the final Torch, TRTLLM, and CuteDSL KDA versions
against the checkout's requirements and checks Torch's CUDA runtime, so a later
dependency install cannot silently downgrade the tested stack.

For PR input, the manual workflow keeps the dispatcher checkout on trusted
`main` and merges the requested PR only in the submitter's temporary worktree.
Without PR input, the selected branch also supplies dispatcher code: select
only trusted same-repository refs for the persistent coordinator. The per-commit
workflow instead executes a same-repository PR's merge commit so dispatcher
changes can be validated before merge. Fork PRs must not use that path while
the coordinator pool is persistent.

For a YAML with multiple runner labels, select one or more explicitly with
repeated `--runner`.
Site-specific scheduler settings can be supplied with `--account`, `--qos`,
`--constraint`, `--time`, and `--gpu-type`. Additional host paths can be
mounted with repeated `--mount HOST:CONTAINER[:FLAGS]` options. Exported
`HF_TOKEN` and `HUGGING_FACE_HUB_TOKEN` values are passed automatically;
`--pass-env NAME` passes other exported variables by name without writing their
values into the job script.

Submitted job snapshots, scripts, metadata, logs, and run results are written
below `.ci-artifacts/slurm` by default. `--render` only prints the command and
script; it does not create or submit them. The artifact root must be writable
from the compute node and should be on shared storage. Use `--artifact-root`
(or `TS_CI_ARTIFACT_ROOT`) to put artifacts elsewhere. `--cache-dir` mounts a
persistent host cache at `/home/runner/.cache`, matching the NVIDIA release
image, and points the Hugging Face and XDG caches there; the directory must
likewise be visible on the compute node.

### Retry unsuccessful Slurm cases

Open **Actions → Retry Failed CI Cases → Run workflow** and enter the run URL
or ID (for example `34550905154`) in `source_run`. The latest completed attempt
of **Slurm Dispatch**, or a previous retry, supplies the failed cases.
Only `COMPLETED` cases with exit code zero and `ok: true` are skipped.
Retries reuse the original submission scripts and source snapshot, preserving
the tested commit, image, configuration and GPU allocation. The original
report artifact and coordinator's `scripts/` and `snapshots/` must still exist.
The existing Slurm Dispatch scheduler defaults and PR installation mode apply.
On retry, the known PyYAML bootstrap command is updated to use the mounted pip
cache, a 120-second socket timeout, and at most three installation attempts
10 seconds apart. Exhausted attempts stop before evaluation. This only changes
dependency download handling; retained files, source commit, image and test
configuration stay unchanged.
For workflows with one case per GitHub job, use **Re-run failed jobs**.
