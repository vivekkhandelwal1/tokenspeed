"""Fused kernels for the PLE (predictive latent embedding) block.

Every launcher here works on the packed-free layout: a flat
``[total_tokens, ...]`` tensor plus per-token ``(req, col)`` coordinates and
per-request ``starts``, with the pre-batch state carried in a separate
``[bs, ...]`` tensor. Kernels that span the request boundary address the
virtual sequence ``[carried state | tokens]`` and pick each tap's source from
the two, so the padded ``[bs, max_len, ...]`` intermediates of the eager path
are never built.

Block configurations are static heuristics, so every launcher is CUDA-graph
capturable. PDL is enabled per launch from :func:`pdl_enabled`, matching the
rest of the package.

        key_weight: Grouped Gemma gamma for the key norm, shaped
            ``[hc_count * hidden_size]``.
        query_weight: Grouped Gemma gamma for the query norm.
        conv_weight: Grouped Gemma gamma for the conv-input norm.
        hc_count: Number of hyper-connection branches.
        hidden_size: Width of one branch.
        eps: Epsilon shared by the three norms.

    Returns:
        A pair of the gated value stream and its normalized form, both shaped
        ``[total_tokens, hc_count * hidden_size]``.
